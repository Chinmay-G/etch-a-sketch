1)  Understanding the problem
- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs
    - Using JS and not html.. can wrap in a div in html
    - Should be able to manipulate the number of squares according to user input, without changing the number of pixels (space) used.
    - Use flexbox, and not grid
- When hovered over a sqaure, it's color should change randomly
- Additionally, the squares should get 10% darker each time hovered over.. making it black when hovered 10 times over it.
- Make room for extra features, such as a particular color that can be selected. (Own)

2) Breaking down the problem
- Create squares using JS and flexbox - HOW?
- Manipuate the number of squares each side within the same space - HOW?
- button and input box to manipulate the number of squares
- Add hover random color effects on the squares
- Make sqaures 10% darker each time hovered over (use opacity) - HOW?
